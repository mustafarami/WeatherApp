# C# and .NET Learning Project

This repository contains a simple project that I created to learn and practice C# and .NET. The purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience with building .NET applications and understanding the fundamentals of C# programming.

## Project Overview

The main project in this repository is a **Weather App** that fetches real-time weather data using an external API (OpenWeatherMap) and displays it to the user. This project helped me practice and learn the following:

- Making HTTP requests using `HttpClient`
- Parsing JSON data with `Newtonsoft.Json` or `System.Text.Json`
- Handling asynchronous programming with `async` and `await`
- Building and structuring a basic .NET console application

## Features

- **Fetch Weather Data**: Get current weather information by entering a city name.
- **Data Display**: Display weather descriptions, temperature, and wind speed.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for failed API requests and invalid input.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **.NET Core**
- **HttpClient** for making API calls
- **Newtonsoft.Json** for JSON parsing (optional: `System.Text.Json`)
